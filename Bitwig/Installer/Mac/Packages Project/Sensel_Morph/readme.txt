In order to build installer, you’ll need to:
 
* place a current copy of “SenselMorph” controller scripts at the destination location on your system (/Users/Shared/SenselMorph)
* place a current copy of the “Project” folder (has a Live project) at the destination location on your system (/Users/Shared/Project)
* place a current copy of the “Overlays” folder (has a Live project) at the destination location on your system (/Users/Shared/Overlays)

before building.  There’s surely a better way to do this, but this is a good start.

The project file uses the Packages software available here: http://s.sudre.free.fr/Software/Packages/about.html
