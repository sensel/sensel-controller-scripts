The .iss is currently looking for source files from the git repo here:
	C:\Users\irving\Documents\GitHub\sensel-controller-scripts\Ableton\*
To run this from your local machine you'll need to clone this repo:
	https://github.com/sensel/sensel-controller-scripts.git
somewhere then fix the path in the .iss.
