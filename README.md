All the details about installing third-party scripts can be found on the [https://help.ableton.com/hc/en-us/articles/209072009-Installing-third-party-remote-scripts](Ableton site).

## Ableton Live 11 MPE
A complete script for Live 11, with MPE support. This has very different maps from the Ableton Live 10 script. The scripts and maps are not interchangeable.
This is a first beta release, and the mappings may change! The functions are extremely similar to the Bitwig scripts - you can refer to the guides in the Bitwig folder for now.

Refer to the "manual Install" for Live 10 above. If you are running both, you can rename teh "Sensel_Morph" folder to "Sensel_Morph11".

Preset 8 can be used with the Sarah Belle Reid Sound Worlds preset Pack. Preset 9 can be used with sonicLAB Fundamental.
