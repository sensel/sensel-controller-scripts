Any disputes between or claims brought by you or us arising out of or related to the these Term, Software or Services ("Subject Matter"), including tort as well as contract claims, and whether pre-contractual or extra-contractual, as well as the enforceability of this section 11 and the arbitrability of any disputes (subject to sections 11(a) and 11(b) below) will be referred to and finally settled by binding arbitration as specified in this section 11. If you are a US resident, such arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA), in accordance with (except as inconsistent with this section 11) the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect at the time of arbitration (current version available here). If you are not a resident of the US, arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator of the International Court of Arbitration in accordance with (except as inconsistent with this section 11) the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce, Expedited Procedures (current version available here). All arbitral proceedings, hearings and submissions will be in the English language. This section 11 states the exclusive means of resolving disputes between the parties regarding the Subject Matter, and the parties therefore waive the right to a trial by jury. The arbitration will be conducted by telephone, videoconference, and/or based solely on written submissions if (a) the credibility of testifying witnesses is unnecessary to the resolution of the dispute; (b) the parties agree to waive in-person appearances; (c) the applicable arbitration rules permit waiver of or otherwise don't require in-person appearances; (d) the claim does not exceed $10,000; or (e) the arbitrator determines that in-person appearances are unnecessary or unhelpful, or would be burdensome to any of the parties to the arbitration or to their staff. If in-person appearance is required, and you are a US resident, such hearings will be held in any one of the following cities that is closest to your residence: New York City, New York; Chicago, Illinois; or San Francisco, California. If in-person appearance is required, and you are not a US resident, such hearings will be held in any one of the following cities that is closest to your residence: New York City, New York; Chicago, Illinois; San Francisco, California; Tokyo, Japan; or London, England. For clarity, nothing in these terms abrogates either party's right to a transcription of all arbitration proceedings at such party's own expense. Except to the extent required by law or in order to enforce arbitral awards in court, the parties shall keep confidential, make no public announcements regarding, and shall not disclose the existence of (f) any dispute, (g) the existence or details of the arbitration proceeding, and (h) all related documents, materials, evidence, judgments and awards therein.11.1	The parties hereby agree to only bring claims in an individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, consolidated or representative proceeding. All disputes will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. The arbitrator does not have the power to vary these provisions. The validity and effectiveness of this section 11.1 is not arbitrable.11.2	Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this section 11 will preclude the right and ability of either party to bypass arbitration and file and maintain at any time: (a) an individual action in US small claims court (if such court may rightfully exercise jurisdiction over the parties and subject matter); (b) an action for recovery of injunctive or provisional relief in any court of competent jurisdiction under the laws applicable thereto; and (c) an action claiming infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property rights in any court of competent jurisdiction under the laws applicable thereto. Such actions, either party's right to pursue such actions, and the validity and effectiveness of this section 11.2, are not arbitrable.11.3	Subject to sections 11.1 and 11.2, all claims and disputes between the parties relating to the Subject Matter must be resolved using arbitration in accordance with this section 11. Should either party file an action contrary to this section, the other party may recover lawyers' fees and costs associated with enforcing this section, provided that the party seeking the award has notified the other party in writing of the improperly filed claim, and the other party has failed to withdraw the claim in a timely fashion.12.	Severability.  If any of the provisions of this EULA are held to be in violation of applicable law, void, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such provisions will not affect the validity of the balance of the EULA, and such provisions are herewith waived or reformed to the extent necessary for the EULA to be otherwise enforceable in such jurisdiction.13.	Integration.  This EULA supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written agreements, communications, proposals and representations with respect to its subject matter.  No modification to the EULA will be binding, unless in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Sensel.14.	California-Based. The Software is provided from Sensel's offices in California. Sensel makes no representation that the Software is appropriate for use in other jurisdictions.
